## Overview

**Decoraphonic** is a modular, cylindrical wireless speaker system designed to blend into home decor as a curio or plant stand. It delivers high-fidelity, room-filling sound through a 2-way configuration: a down-firing woofer and a forward-facing full-range driver. The enclosure is 3D-printed in interlocking segments, covered with a speaker cloth sleeve (interchangeable), and capped with (also interchangeable) magnetic wooden endplates.

## Core Features

- **2-Way Audio**: Down-firing woofer + forward-facing full-range driver
- **DSP-Enabled Bi-Amping**: Active crossover, EQ presets, and Music Assistant sync
- **Modular Construction**: Twist-lock 3D-printed segments with internal cable routing - designed for simultaneous printing on 3D printers with a 250x250x250mm (or greater) build volume. 
- **Elegant Form Factor**: 42" tall, 6" diameter with customizable cloth and wood finishes
- **Smart Control**: Companion app for EQ, LED behavior, and multi-room configuration

## Expansion Path

A future variant, **Decoraphonic Voice**, explores integration with Home Assistant’s Voice Assist stack. This would enable:

- Local wake-word detection and speech-to-text
- Smart home control via Home Assistant
- LED feedback and app-based configuration
- SBC-driven control of DSP, amp, and lighting
